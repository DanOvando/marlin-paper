## Lots of Spatio-Temporal Models Out There

## The marlin package

[`marlin`](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/) is an R package currently available on GitHub

```{r}
#| eval: false

remotes::install_github("danovando/marlin")

```

Core Features

- Full age structure of multiple fish(y) critters (automated life history with [FishLife](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishLife))

- Multiple fleets and *m√©tiers* enabling **technical interactions**
  - Input controls, output controls, bio-economic dynamics

- 2-D spatial structure with scale-free and estimable movement

- Fast! (fractions of a second for 10x10 system over 20 years with quarterly steps)

## The marlin Package

Best suited for *what if* as opposed to *what will* questions

## Fish Model

## Movement Model

## Fleet Model

## Manager Model

## Coral Reef Case Study

## Equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
n_{t,p,s,a = 1} = \left(\frac{0.8{\times}\sum_{p=1}^P{r0_{p,s}}\times{h_s}\times\sum_{p=1}^P{ssb_{t-1,p,s}}}{0.2\times{\sum_{p=1}^Pssb0_{p,s}} \times(1 - h_s)+(h_s - 0.2) \times{\sum_{p=1}^Pssb_{t-1,p,s}}}\right) \times \\ {r0_{p,s} / \sum_p^P{r0_{p,s}}\times \epsilon_{t,s}
}
\end{aligned}

## Linking to Team Tuna


- Still stuck in the dietary dark ages 
  - Diet data could be used to inform taxis matrix?
  
- Humans need to be part of the "diet Renaissance"!

- Provides a direct and mechanistic link between tagging studies and simulation work
  - Can be linked to advection and environmental covariates as a bonus!
  
- Future work adding in more species modules
  - Seabirds?
  - Marine mammals?
  - Turtles?
