## Population-Effects of MPAs



:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Thanks to co-authors and PISCO divers
- MPAs a growing part of marine management toolkit
- *Predicting* and *estimating* effects critical for planning and adaptation

**What effects do protected areas have on populations inside and outside of borders?**

## MPAs have Complex Effects {.smaller}


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Fishing closures have complex impacts beyond borders


- "spillover" of adult or larval organisms
  
- Displacement of human activities 

- Across multiple species and fleets!


**Creates a challenge for both predicting and estimating effects of spatial policies**

## MPAs - The Evidence {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%}

:::{.incremental}
- MPAs seem simple: 
  - *Less fishing, more fish*
  
- Ample evidence of **more everything** inside MPAs than outside (Lester *et al.* 2009)

- Problem solved?

  - Fish and Fishers move

  - What do we do when the **treatment** affects the **control**
  
  How do we estimate **net effect** inside and out?

## The Challenge of Spatial MPA evaluation

::: {.incremental}

- The goal of a control site is to account for **differences and changes caused by things other than the MPA that you do not directly observe**

- The **closer** your control site, the more risk of spillover and fleet movement affecting your "control" 


- The **further** your control site, the less likely it will experience common environmental shocks


- Is there an alternative to spatial controls?

## Estimating Population-Level Effects

### General form

$$(log(D_{MPA=1, T = 1})-log(D_{MPA=0, T = 1}))-(log(D_{MPA = 1,T = 0})-log(D_{MPA =0, T = 0}))$$


### Bayesian Gamma GLM 

$$d_{i} \sim Gamma(e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1T_{i} +  \beta_2MPA_{i} + \beta_{3}T_iMPA_i + \mathbf{B^cX_i} + \mathbf{B^sS_i}},shape)$$


### Hierarchical clustering of sites by island
$$\mathbf{B^s} \sim N(\beta_r,\sigma_r)$$

## Effects of Protected Areas {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Critical to consider effects **inside** and **outside**

-  **Population** effects may be smaller and harder to find than conventionally thought

- Uncertainty does not preclude action

- Communities should have a clear understanding of full range of possible effects of protected areas

## The Next Generation of MPA Models

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Empirical strategies should...

- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Have a clear and defensible strategy for causal inference
- Be grounded in theory

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

Predictive models should...

- Assess where they fall on the "tactical" to "strategic" spectrum
- Acknowledge, explore, and communicate key uncertainties
- Remember that all models are wrong, some are useful

## Reliable Estimation Matters

![](imgs/complexity.png)

## `marlin`

Be on the lookout for a new MPA modeling tool called [`marlin`](https://danovando.github.io/marlin/) in the coming year. 

- Full age structure
- 2D spatial structure
- Multi-species & Multi-fleet
- Realistic movement dynamics

**Facilitate simulation testing of MPA design outcomes**

> The jury is in on marine reserves: They work.
> Research has repeatedly shown that fish numbers quickly climb following well-enforced fishing bans, 
> creating tangible benefits for fishers who work the surrounding waters.
