<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Communities around the world are increasingly looking to spatial strategies for managing marine ecosystems. For example, the “30x30” movement calls for implementation of marine protected areas, a form of spatial management, across 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. While the objectives of individual spatial management strategies vary widely, spatial management strategies are often supported based on their ability to provide protection to broad swaths of marine ecosystems with one management action, with potentially fewer costs and complications than for example assessing, setting, and enforcing catch quotas for individual species.</p>
<p>However, the design of spatial management strategies faces numerous challenges. Marine ecosystems are highly dynamic and opaque, and extractive entities such as fishing fleets respond to changes in marine ecosystems in highly complex ways. These dynamics post challenges even for single-species assessment and management strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="field2006a">(<a href="#ref-field2006a" role="doc-biblioref">Field et al. 2006</a>)</span>, which are only amplified when we consider management policies specifically designed around spatial features in the oceans. For example, policies such as MPAs designed for both conservation and food security must consider factors such as the optimal size and placement of a protected area network given a wide array of life history, exploitation levels, fleet dynamics, and preferred habitats, all of which may change over time, particularly given the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>These challenges are amplified by the fact that our knowledge regarding the design and implementation of spatial management strategies such as MPAs is largely based on theoretical studies; the size of protected areas <span class="citation" data-cites="ovando2021a">(<a href="#ref-ovando2021a" role="doc-biblioref">Ovando et al. 2021</a>)</span> and time required<span class="citation" data-cites="nickols2019">(<a href="#ref-nickols2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nickols et al. 2019</a>)</span> to see substantial effects from many MPAs means that we have relatively little empirical evidence as to their large-scale effects under a range of social-ecological settings <span class="citation" data-cites="mcclanahan2021">(<a href="#ref-mcclanahan2021" role="doc-biblioref">McClanahan 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Many models have been developed to support the theory and design of spatial management strategies <span class="citation" data-cites="fulton2015">(<a href="#ref-fulton2015" role="doc-biblioref">Fulton et al. 2015</a>)</span>. However, they have tended to fall into one of either highly complex and tactical models designed for use in a specific location, or to be highly stylized representations intended to provide theoretical insights with less relevance for highly specific design questions. This complex landscape presents a challenge to stakeholders charged with marine spatial planning exercises lacking accesible models suited for more tactical applications, and a barrier to the scientific community, wherein comparisons across spatial management simulation studies are clouded by discrepancies in underlying model structures beyond differences in the core phenomenon in question.</p>
<p>In part to help address this challenge, we present here a novel bio-economic modeling framework called <code>marlin</code> that allows for efficient simulation of spatio-temporal biological and economic dynamics. <code>marlin</code> allows users to simulation the impacts spatial policies such as MPAs across a range of species targeted by various fleets across heterogeneous and dynamic seascapes. Here we present the core methods and functionality of this framework, and demonstrate its use in two xx case-study applications. In the first, we show how <code>marlin</code> can be used to assess critical drivers for positive outcomes and unintended consequences of MPAs as a bycatch-mitigation strategy. In the second, we present a more tactical application, demonstrating how <code>marlin</code> can be used to compare and design MPA networks to achieve societal objectives.</p>

<section id="methods" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>Models of MPAs span a wide range of complexity, from simple analytical tools to end-to-end ecosystem models <span class="citation" data-cites="fulton2015">(<a href="#ref-fulton2015" role="doc-biblioref">Fulton et al. 2015</a>)</span>. <code>marlin</code> follows a “models of intermediate complexity” (MICE) philosophy <span class="citation" data-cites="plagányi2014">(<a href="#ref-plagányi2014" role="doc-biblioref">Plagányi et al. 2014</a>)</span> targeted specifically around the role of technical interactions across species. Many MPA models simulate the impacts of MPAs on a single-species level <span class="citation" data-cites="ovando2021a">(<a href="#ref-ovando2021a" role="doc-biblioref">Ovando et al. 2021</a>)</span>. This can be useful for for example examining the ways in which species-specific life history traits interact with fleet dynamics to influence MPA outcomes. However, bycatch problems are driven by technical interactions, in which fishing effort for a target species incidentally captures another species. <code>marlin</code> accounts for this by allowing the user to simulate an arbitrary number of fleets capable of catching an arbitrary number of species in a spatial area. Different fleets can place different economic value on different species, while also having species-specific selectivity functions. This allows us to simulate bycatch dynamics of MPAs in pelagic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Below we provide a summary of the <code>marlin</code> model, as well as details of the generalized simulation exercises and case study analyses.</p>
<section id="fleet-dynamics" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fleet-dynamics">Fleet Dynamics</h3>
<p>The key feature of <code>marlin</code> for the purposes of this project is the ability to capture technical interactions across species. While marlin does not simulate species interactions, fishing fleets in <code>marlin</code> are capable of targeting and affecting multiple species simultaneously. This allows us to capture for example the potential impacts of displacement of effort from one area into another across multiple species.</p>
<p>A fishing fleet or <em>metier</em> is defined in <code>marlin</code> by a total pool of effort that can have different catchability, prices, and selectivity for individual species within a simulation. For example, both a longline and purse seine fleet may capture bigeye (<em>Thunnus obesus</em>) and skipjack (<em>Katswamus pelamus</em>), but the longline fleet is much more likely to catch bigeye than skipjack, and <em>vice versa</em>. Each fishing fleet generates catches, revenues, and profits from individual species that it targets, and makes decisions based on its total objective function across all species.</p>
<p>Revenues <em>R</em> for fleet <em>f</em> in time step <em>t</em> are given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R_{t,p,f} = \sum_s^S \sum_a^A \Pi_{s,f}\frac{\alpha_{a,s,f}q_{s,f}E_{t,p,f}}{F_{t,p,s,a}} \times Y_{t,p,s,a}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>p</em> is patch, <em>s</em> is species, <em>a</em> is age, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is selectivity at age, <em>q</em> is catchability , <em>F</em> is total fishing mortality, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi\)</span> is price per unit weight, and <em>Y</em> is total catches.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y_{t,p,s,a} = \frac{F_{t,p,s,a}}{z_{t,p,s,a}} \times b_{t,p,s,a} \times (1 - e^{-z_{t,p,s,a}})
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>F</em> is total fishing mortality, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
F_{t,p,s,a} = \sum_f^F\alpha_{a,s,f}q_{s,f}E_{t,p,f}
\]</span></p>
<p>Selectivity <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is modeled through a logistic form per</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\alpha_{a,s,f}=\frac{1}{(1 + e^{-log(19)\times\frac{l_{a,s} - l^{sel}_{s,f}}{\delta^{sel}_{s,f}}})}
  (\#eq:sel)
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is length at age, <span class="math inline">\(l^{sel}\)</span> is the length at 50% selectivity, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the difference between the length at 50% selectivity and the length at 95% selectivity.</p>
<p><em>z</em> is total mortality given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
z_{t,p,s,a} = F_{t,p,s,a} + m_{s,a}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where <em>m</em> is natural mortality.</p>
<p>This means that each species experiences a total mortality at age in a time step in a patch, individual fractions of which are portioned off as catches and subsequently revenues for each fleet. Given revenues, we then calculate profits <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> per</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\phi_{t,p,f} = R_{t,p,f} - c_f(E_{t,p,f} + 1)_{t,p,f}
^{1.3}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>c</em> is cost per unit effort and, the 1.3 exponent is in the manner of <span class="citation" data-cites="costello2016a">Costello et al. (<a href="#ref-costello2016a" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> . The addition of one to the total effort is to constrain the value to be greater than 1, preventing undesired behavior where fishing effort actually gets less expensive if total effort is less than 1.</p>
<p>The important feature here then is that the revenues and profits for a given fleet are a function of the prices and catchability of individual species, but that mortality itself is independent of price. So, a fleet that has selectivity and catchability greater than zero can exert fishing mortality on a species even if it obtains no value from that species.</p>
<p>Each fishing fleet then decides how to allocate its effort in space based on one of four possible spatial allocation strategies. The ideal free distribution (IFD) is the standard method for distributing fishing fleets in spaces (see <span class="citation" data-cites="gillis2003">Gillis (<a href="#ref-gillis2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> and references therein). However, the IFD presents a number of complications for our study. First, in order to simplify the assessment of the impacts of different fishing mortality rates we simulate scenarios with a fixed total pool of effort. As MPAs change the spatial distribution of profits though, the total amount of effort required to satisfy the IFD may not equal the total amount of effort required by the model. Second, even if we were to implement the IFD for a single fleet, the model is capable of tracking multiple fleets at once. This means that the IFD for a single fleet would be a game-theoretic outcome of the actions of each of the individual fleet conditional on the actions of all other fleets. While possible to implement this would slow down our model runs to the point of practically preventing large-scale evaluation of the effects of MPAs on bycatch.</p>
<p>As such we explored a series of “next best” fleet distribution algorithms. While not the IFD in any individual time step, over time they start to approximate the IFD, as each assumes that fleets base their decisions for the current time step on the outcomes in the prior timestep, meaning that the impacts of the actions of other fishing fleets are somewhat internalized. The four possible fleet distribution algorithms are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Revenue per unit effort (RPUE): The fleet distributes itself in space based on revenue per unit effort</li>
<li>Revenue: The fleet distributes itself in space based on revenue</li>
<li>Profit per unit effort (PPUE): The fleet distributes itself in space based on profit per unit effort</li>
<li>Profit: The fleet distributes itself in space based on profit</li>
</ol>
<p>Revenue based spatial distribution is not likely to be very realistic . However, due to the complexity of parameterizing cost functions fleet dynamics are often evaluated based on yield or revenue alone, and so we include those scenarios here to evaluate the potential implications of this choice. The decision on whether to allocate the fleet based on absolute or relative (per unit effort) is more complex. When effort represents the actions of separate and individual fishing actors (e.g. independent fishing vessels), a per-unit-effort strategy may be more realistic, in which fishers distribute themselves based on the expected catch of their individual efforts <span class="citation" data-cites="hilborn1987">(<a href="#ref-hilborn1987" role="doc-biblioref">Hilborn and Walters 1987</a>)</span>. Conversely, a system defined by a sole owner seeking to maximize total profits might be better represented by a fleet model based on total profits</p>

<p><code>marlin</code>’s movement dynamics are based on a continuous-time Markov chain, as described in <span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2021a">Thorson et al. (<a href="#ref-thorson2021a" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>. Within this framework, the model allows for movement to be broken down into three components of <em>diffusion</em>, <em>advection</em> (follow currents), and <em>taxis</em> (active movement towards say a preferred habitat).</p>
<p>xx movement equations xx</p>
<p>While this approach to movement simulation is not commonly seen in the marine modeling literature, it has numerous advantages that warrant its seeming complexity. First, when only diffusion is present, the model will generalize to the familiar dynamics of a Gaussian dispersal kernel xx check this xx. However, the time component <em>t</em> in equation xx allows the movement model to be run on arbitrary time steps while preserving its behavior.</p>
<p>Second, the <em>advection</em> component allows users to input useful features such as the outputs of ROMs models.xxx</p>
<p>Third, the <em>taxis</em> model allow for more active habitat choices by species, allowing us to simulate both preferences of species in space and time efficiently.</p>
<p>In this way then, <code>marlin</code> allows users to run anything from a simple Gaussian dispersal kernel up to a system governed by species that passively diffuse around a dynamic thermal range</p>
<p>Lastly, this form has the advantage that the parameters are directly estimable from real data. So, if provided with say CPUE data and a tagging study, users can estimates the movement parameters in the same manner as <span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2021">(<a href="#ref-thorson2021" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>thorson2021?</strong></a>)</span>, and then pass their estimated parameters to <code>marlin</code> for simulation.</p>

<p>We consider 5 different MPA placement strategies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Depletion: MPA locations are prioritized in proportion to the spawning stock biomass of the most depleted species pre-MPA. So, patches with high spawning biomass of highly depleted species are prioritized over patches with high spawning biomass of lightly depleted species.</p></li>
<li><p>Rate: MPAs are placed in based on the pre-MPA depletion-weighted catch relative to the total catch in a patch. So, patches with high rates of catch of depleted species relative to total catch are prioritized.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid_fishing: MPAs locations are prioritized inversely to fishery catches. So, patches with low catches are prioritized over patches with high catches.</p></li>
<li><p>Target_fishing: MPAs locations are prioritized proportionally to fishery catches. So, patches with high total catches are prioritized over patches with low catches.</p></li>
<li><p>Area: For the “area” strategy, we simply assign patches in sequential order until the desired total MPA size is reached.</p></li>
</ol>
<!-- The information used to inform each MPA design strategy (except area) -->
<!-- can include a multiplicative observation error term $\sigma_{obs}$ where -->
<!-- $$information \sim lnorm(data,\sigma_{obs}) $$ -->
<!-- For example, for the depletion scenario, $\sigma_{obs}$ controls the -->
<!-- accuracy of the spatial depletion data used to prioritize MPA placement. -->

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mpa-optimization">MPA Optimization</h2>
<p>Our MPA optimization algorithm seems to create an MPA network that maximizes an objective function, given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[obj_p = \Phi \times scale(\sum_f^F \boldsymbol{\phi_{f,p}}) + (1 - \Phi)  scale(\boldsymbol{\sum_s^S\frac{ssb_s}{ssb0_{s,p}}})\]</span></p>
<p>Where <em>scale</em> rescales the values to be between 0 and 1 such that the weight parameter is comparable between vectors. The algorithm works by first assigning every patch in the system to an MPA. For the first round, the algorithm then calculates the equilibrium objective function value resulting from sequentially removing each individual patch from the MPA network. The cell whose removal from the MPA produces the highest objective function value is then removed from the MPA network, and the marginal value of the objective function each of the remaining cells from the last steps are then stored. For the next steps, we sampled 25% of the remaining MPA cells with probability proportional to their marginal contribution to the objective function in the prior iteration, selecting the cell whose removal produces the highest total objective function as the cell to remove from the network, and updating the marginal value of the sampled-but-not-selected cells. This in essence is a sampling-importance-resampling algorithm. The algorithm continues until no more cells are left in the MPA. This then provides for a given objective weighting value <span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span> the near-optimal MPA network at every MPA size from 0 to 100%. We say “near” as they is some path dependency here, in that for example the network that maximizes the objective function with 40% of the MPAs does not necessarily contain the optimal network at 30%. However, the reversed nature of the algorithm, starting at 100% MPA coverage and working better, produces a more stable network with regards to this problem than starting at 0% and growing to 100%.</p>

<section id="generalized-experiments" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generalized-experiments">Generalized Experiments</h2>
<p>Two features of marine ecosystems that are often omitted from theoretical and simulation-based considerations of marine spatial planning are <em>technical interactions</em> and <em>species on the move</em>. May canonical MPA models, informed by planning efforts centered around relatively static features such as coral reefs, have assumed that species inhabit a fixed and often uniform (e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="hastings2017">Hastings, Gaines, and Costello (<a href="#ref-hastings2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). In reality, the habitat of many species are heterogeneous in space, and can experience both seasonal and directional changes, e.g.&nbsp;climate-change mediated range shifts.</p>
<p>This reality creates a basic challenge to MPA design, in that given the need to protect an area less than the total range of a species, the more complex and dynamics the habitat of the species the more challenging it will be to identify an area that provides effective protection today and tomorrow. However, <em>technical interactions</em> interact with this spatial complexity to create another and potentially more difficult challenge. One of the key questions around spatial management strategies such as MPAs is to what extent do they <em>remove</em> vs <em>displace</em> threats.</p>
<p>The potential benefits of MPAs as a bycatch management are complicated by two key issues: effort displacement and technical interactions. One of the primary questions around MPAs is to what extent do MPAs remove versus displace fishing effort. If MPAs remove fishing effort, then their direct effects on target and bycatch species can only be positive. If however MPAs displace fishing effort, evaluating their potential impacts becomes more complicated. The net conservation impact of MPAs becomes a balancing act between the effects of reduced fishing inside protected borders and increased fishing intensity outside MPAs. The outcomes of this displacement can be further complicated by technical interactions, i.e.&nbsp;the degree to which fishing effort for one species affects another, particularly when species have markedly different habitat distributions. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="abbott2012">Abbott and Haynie (<a href="#ref-abbott2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> demonstrated that an MPA designed to protect red king crab (<em>Paralithodes camtschaticus</em>) caused an unintended increase in bycatch of Pacific halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) by the displaced bottom-trawl fishery.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the operating model used here, a complete sensitivity analysis across all parameters is not practical. Instead, we focus on the role of life history, fishing pressure, and MPA design.</p>
<p>Each iteration uses one of three species: A stylized tuna modeled after skipjack tuna (), a stylized marlin modeled after (), and a stylized shark modeled after (). Each species has all life history parameters pulled from FishLife (<span class="citation" data-cites="thorson2020">Thorson (<a href="#ref-thorson2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>), with the exception of steepness, set to XX, and fecundity. For the tuna and marlin species, fecundity is assumed to scale with weight modified by the hyperallometric exponent. For the shark species, we assume a constant value of six pups per year at all ages greater than the age at maturity. We assume that tunas have an unfished biomass of XX, marlins XX, and sharks XX, to reflect a large, medium, and small population.</p>
<p>For the generalized experiments we only include one fishing fleet. We assign a price per KG of $XX for tuna, intended to reflect a low value high volume fishery, $XX for marlin for a higher value low volume fishery, and $0 for sharks to reflect at true bycatch species. We assign a selectivity of 60% of length at maturity for skipjack to allow for some overfishing when F/M is high enough, 70% for marlin, and 90% for shark.</p>
<p>We ran 300 state experiments, varying the state of nature experienced by a simulation. The candidate states include</p>

<p>For each of these 300 state experiments, we then apply 315 placement experiments defined by an MPA size, an MPA placement strategy, and …XX</p>
<p>We simulate degrees of species overlap using two parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_h\)</span>. All species start with the assumption that the centroid of their preferred habitat occurs in the center-most patch of the two dimensional system simulated by marlin. For our simulations, we then generated a random deviation from that default centroid for each species using <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_c\)</span> in the manner</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[centroid_s \sim normal(center,\sigma_c)\]</span> where <em>s</em> denotes species,</p>
<p>and <em>center</em> is the coordinate of the central cell. In this way, the larger <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_c\)</span> grows, the more variation there is between the centroid of the preferred habitat for each species.</p>
<p>We then control the spread of a creatures preferred habitat around that centroid per a Gaussian dispersal kernel in the manner</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[habitat_{p,s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma_h^2}}e^{-\frac{d_p^2}{2\sigma_h^2}}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the euclidean distance from the <span class="math inline">\(centroid_s\)</span> to patch <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_h\)</span> controls the dispersal of the habitat around that range.</p>
